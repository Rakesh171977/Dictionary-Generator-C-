Dictionary Generator: Developed a Dictionary Generator in C++ that dynamically creates and stores word lists, supporting various data structures for efficient lookup and retrieval.

Efficient Word Storage: Implemented data structures like hash tables and binary search trees in C++ to optimize word search and insertion operations within the dictionary.

File Handling: Integrated file I/O operations in C++ to read from and write to external text files, allowing the dictionary to be populated from large datasets.

User Interface: Created a command-line interface for users to input, search, and manage words in the dictionary, providing real-time feedback and interaction.
